At UC Davis, I was fortunately advised by Prof. Chen-Nee Chuah and had worked on several self-driving and medical image 
related projects with her, such as path finding, visual SLAM and image segementation. I received best senior design 
of a year (Visual SLAM using ORB-SLAM2 with Path Finding). Our automatic white/grey matter image segementation technique 
was accepted by IEEE access. I was fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. William Wang and Prof. Lei Li during PhD. 
They opened a new world for me in NLP!
